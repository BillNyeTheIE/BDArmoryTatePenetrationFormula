Changes/additions to vanilla BDAc 1.3.4
=======================================
-Complete overhaul of ModuleWeapon

	*Now supports magazine-fed weapons that must be occasionally reloaded			
	*Now supports burst-fire weapons (multiple shots per fire command)		
	*Now supports crewed weapons that require a kerbal present to fire		
	*RocketLaucher functionality has been folded into ModuleWeapon, Rocketlaunchers will need to be reconfigured. A MM patch for legacy rocketlauncher support is included
	*RocketLaunchers can now be supplied from external ammo boxes. 
	*Gyrojet guns now supported	
	*Rocket class weapons can now use FlaK settings (airDetonation, proximityDetonation, 

maxAirDetonationRange)
	*Can set custom fire sounds for Rockets

	==============================
	*New ModuleWeapon .cfg settings
	==============================
	BeltFed = False // enables mag-fed weapons
	RoundsPerMag = n // shots per magazine or shots per burst if BurstFire = true
	ReloadTime = n // time(sec) needed to reload
	BurstFire = true // enables burst fire; use with RoundsPerMag
	crewserved = true // weapon part must have CrewCapacity > 0 and Kerbal occupant
	externalAmmo = true // rocket class weapons use external ammo boxes
	rocketPod = true // default true, used if rocketpod w/ rocket submodels (e.g. Hydra70)
		setting rocketPod = true will default RoundsPerMag to the # of rocket submodels
		setting rocketpod = false will automatically set externalAmmo = true
		RocketPod = true and externalAmmo = true will set BeltFed = false

-Rework of AI weapon management

	*AI will now use rocket pods
	*Slight improvement to bomb selection logic

-Rework of Pilot AI

	*Steer Limiter now properly labeled steer limiter, not stages number
	*AI will now make greater use of Yaw control authority for fine yaw adjustment 

	================
	*New AI settings - require advanced tweakables enabled
	================
	Speed-Adjusted Steer Limiter //secondary, speed-adjusted steer limiter. Should be of use to FAR users
	Adjusted Limiter Speed // speed threshold the adjusted limiter takes effect. Also should be of use to FAR users.	
	Extend Distance // distance AI will extend to regain energy
	Missile Evade Distance // distance AI will break to avoid missiles
	AI Personality // standard or reckless behavior

-Gameplay / UI changes
	*Weapon Manager GUI reads BDAc 1.3.4. SI, to differentiate this fork of BDA from vanilla
	*Fixes weapon ammo count in the Weaponmanager GUI
	*GUI windows - RWR, Radar, VesselSwitch,etc. can now be moved off screen
	*Bullet damage calc extended
		-Bullets down to 5mm caliber will properly deal damage now
		-The APBulletMod value in BulletDef.cfg is now implemented, and works as a 

multiplier. APBM = 1 is standard penetration, 0.5 would halve bullet penetration depth, 1.5 would 

increase bullet penetration by 150%, etc.
	*Updates HP calc - will now give wings and B9 proc parts reasonable Hp values for their 

size/mass. Mainly for HP clacs vis-a-vis FAR dynamic mass adjustment for smooth scaling
	*HP vaules now increase/decrease by 25 instead of 100
	*Adds PaintBall Mode - Exactly what it says on the tin; nonlethal mode for testing or fun
	*Adds FuelTank penetration - LF & LF/O tanks that get shot will start to leak fuel
	*Adds Battle damage to parts
		-Engine damage will reduce thrust and eventually shutdown the engine
		-Wing and ctrl surface damage will reduce lift
		-SAS damage will reduce available torque
		-Sufficient cockpit/cabin damage will kill kerbals inside them
	*Changes to BDA settings Window
	*Instakill setting now works properly
	*Adds PaintBall setting - toggles PaintBall Mode
	*Strict Window Boundaries setting - allows GUI windows to be moved off-screen. Reenabling will snap any offscreen windows to nearest screen edge.
	*Battle damage setting - toggles part battle damage consequences
	
-Expanded BDArmory settings for BDArmorySettings.cfg
	*PAINTBALL = False
	*BATTLEDAMAGE = False
	*STRICT_WINDOW_BOUNDARIES = FALSE
	*SELFSEALING_TANKS = TRUE

-Updates BDArmory/Localization/UI/en-us.cfg with the new Pilot AI settings
	*#LOC_BDArmory_SASteerLimiter = Speed-Adjusted Steer Limiter
	*#LOC_BDArmory_LimiterSpeed = Adjusted Limiter Speed
	*#LOC_BDArmory_ExtendDist = Extend Distance
	*#LOC_BDArmory_EvadeDist = Missile Evade Distance
	*#LOC_BDArmory_AIPersonality = AI Personality
	*#LOC_BDArmory_Reckless = Reckless
	*#LOC_BDArmory_Standard = Standard
